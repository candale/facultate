Substitution Cypher
===================

Given a set of letter that represents the alphabet (call it key), no matter the order, the encryption is done in the follwoing way:
	- the letters from the alphabet (which is in lexicographic order) are mapped to the key so that every letter from the alphabet has a corresponding
	  letter in the key

In order to obtain a cyphertext we need to replace every leter in the given text with it's corresponding letter form the key.

The decryption goes the other way around:
	- given the key, every letter from the key is mapped to the corresponding letter from the alphabet (which is in lexicographic order)

In order to obtain the original message, every letter from the cyphertext is replaces with it's corresponding letter from the alphabet.
